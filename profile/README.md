## Terra Repositories

Terra is a package repository for Fedora and its derivatives that provides high-quality software built from easy-to-use tools.

Packages in Terra are built using the [Andaman](https://github.com/FyraLabs/anda) toolchain rather than Koji. This provides more flexibility when building packages, and allows
developers to easily serve their software to users.

## Contributing
If you would like to request or submit a new package, make an issue or PR at the [Packages](https://github.com/terrapkg/packages) repository.
